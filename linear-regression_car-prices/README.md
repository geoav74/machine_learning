# **Project**: <font color='red'> Car Prices Prediction </font> <br><br>
---


<br><br>
## **Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to practice in building, implementing and evaluating a Linear Regression Model.
<br><br>

## **Scenario**
I'm working in the XYZ Conculting Company as a ML Engineer. I'm asked from a Car Magazine to build a ML model to predict car prices by Friday so they can write a column about the upcoming car releases that brands has disclosed.
<br><br>

## **Mission** (the who, what, where, when, why)
My mission is, to build a machine learning model at the Co which can predict car prices for a Car Magazine by Friday.  
<br><br>

## **Execution** (how to)
For this project i need to find appropriate data. For this reason i asked the Data Engineering Dept to help me out. After that i organized the work to be done as follows (for educational purposes i'm the Data Engineering Dept ðŸ˜€ ):


### PART 0 (Data Extraction)
  * Libraries
  * Data Retreival

### PART 1 (Data Curation)
* Data Pre-processing
* Data Exploration
* Data Transformation

### PART 2 (Regression Model)
* Baseline Linear Regression Model
* Baseline Model Evaluation

### PART 3 (Optimization)
* Feature Engineering
